This is the React Color Picker field for Hygraph, powered by [React Color](https://github.com/casesandberg/react-color) package.

## Requirements

To use this app, certain pre-requisites have to be met:

- You must have a Hygraph account. If you don't have one, you can create one [here](https://app.hygraph.com/signup).
- You must have a Hygraph [project](https://hygraph.com/docs/guides/getting-started/create-a-project). If you don't have one, check the [starters](https://hygraph.com/marketplace#starters).

## Install the React Color Picker field
